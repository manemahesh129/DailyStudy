// Moment when we seen loops and functions then it will automatically be hot code and we can see the changes in the output without restarting the server. This is called hot code reloading. 

console.log("This is hot code reloading example.");

function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
greet("Alice");

// Now, if we change the greet function to greet("Bob") and save the file, we will see the output change to "Hello, Bob!" without restarting the server. This is hot code reloading in action.
// Hot code reloading is a powerful feature that allows developers to see the changes they make to the code in real-time, which can significantly speed up the development process and improve productivity. It is commonly used in web development frameworks and tools to provide a seamless development experience.
// Hot code examples are often used in development environments to allow developers to see the changes they make to the code without having to restart the server or application. This can be particularly useful when working on user interfaces, as it allows developers to see the changes they make to the UI in real-time, which can help them iterate faster and create better user experiences.
// In summary, hot code reloading is a powerful feature that allows developers to see the changes they make to the code in real-time, which can significantly speed up the development process and improve productivity.
