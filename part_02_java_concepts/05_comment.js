// source code - byte code - machine code
// - JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means that it is executed line by line by the JavaScript engine
// - The JavaScript engine converts the source code into byte code, which is a low-level representation of the code
// - The byte code is then executed by the machine code, which is the native code of the computer
// - Comments can be used to explain the purpose of the code, the logic behind it, and any important details that may not be immediately obvious
// - It is a good practice to use comments to make your code more understandable and maintainable
// - However, it is important to use comments wisely and not overuse them, as too many comments can make the code cluttered and harder to read
// - In summary, comments are an essential part of writing clean and maintainable code, and they play a crucial role in helping developers understand and work with the code effectively.
