// Statements in JavaScript are instructions that perform actions. They can be simple or complex and are typically terminated with a semicolon (;). Statements can include variable declarations, function calls, loops, conditionals, and more. They are the building blocks of JavaScript code and are executed sequentially to achieve the desired functionality.

// Example of a simple statement:
let greeting = "Hello, world!"; // This is a variable declaration statement
console.log(greeting); // This is a function call statement
